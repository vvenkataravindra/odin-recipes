		<p>What is Gutti Vankaya Curry?

Gutti vankaya curry is a classic and delicious Andhra style curry made with small or baby eggplants, peanuts, onions and spices. It is nothing but stuffed baby eggplants with a special peanut masala or filling and cooked in the peanut sauce.

Gutti vankaya means “whole eggplants” and it is a way of cooking where the veggies are stuffed with spices and cooked whole. So you will need to cook them whole without chopping them into pieces. Choose small and same sized eggplants to ensure even cooking.</p>
